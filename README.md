Hi, I'm tantawy ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making contributing to open-source more approachable, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup) and GraphQL. In 2020, I was selected to be an inaugural GitHub Star ðŸŒŸ based on my involvement in the tech community. My interest in the React ecosystem led me to launch React Robins, a community for women and non-binary ReactJS developers.
